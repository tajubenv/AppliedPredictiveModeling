## Introduction

Currently I am working my way through [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/) by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. I'm documenting my work on this mostly so I have a resource to look back through when I encounter similar problems in the future, but also as a way to keep pumping out Capital C Content. The focus of this will be recreating the computations section of each chapter, but I will likely try to produce the same results using a different method to ensure I am actually understanding it. I might even get bold and grab similar real world datasets to those used by the book and attempt similar analyses.
